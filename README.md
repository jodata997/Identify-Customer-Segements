# Unsupervised Learning
## Project: Identify customers segments
### Install
This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an iPython Notebook. 

# Code
The code is provided in the Identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb Jupyter-notebook file.

# Data
The actual data was removed due to terms and conditions of AZ Direct GmbH which prohibits of using data in any other content rather than Udacity course.

# Results
Within the project both general population (Germany) and customers population were compared. Segments were identified that could be target for future marketing campaigns or to be considered outside of company interests. Typical portrait of a customer for different segments was described. More detailed findings can be found in the .ipynb file.
